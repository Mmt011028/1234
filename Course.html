           Chemical subjects study the structure of atoms, molecules and ions, chemical bonds, intermolecular forces and other interactions. Their scale is the closest to the macro in the micro world. Therefore, their natural laws are also most closely related to the physical and chemical properties of substances and materials in the macro world in which human beings live.
